## TODO

* Make the blog post excerpt size bigger.

* Make navbar font bold and maybe tone down orange-ness.

* Pick better/more header fonts?
  - Erin thinks the pixel font is too pixel-y (especially since the background is as well).

* Main font seems too small on Macbook17. Make it bigger? Detect device something-something?

* Make the first page look not so empty.

* Take navbar off first page.
